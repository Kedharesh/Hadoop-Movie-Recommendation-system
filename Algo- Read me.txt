			REDUCER:

 each pair of movies co-occurs in the users' movie rating histories to produce the final co-occurrence matrix.


			(MOVIE1:MOVIE2:(no of times it pairs has watched it))

NORMALIZATION:

		MAPPER:
				MOVIE1:MOVIE2,relations(co occurance matrix)

		REDUCER:
			MOVIE2:MOVIE1,normalization
			similarity/probability


MULTIPICATION:

		The CooccurrenceMapper maps each line of the co-occurrence file to a key-value pair, 
		where the key is the movieB and the value is the movieA=relation.

		 COOCCURANCE MAPPER:      
			MOVIE2,MOVIE1:Relation(no of times it pairs has watched it)


 		 RATING MAPPER:
			The RatingMapper maps each line of the rating file to a key-value pair, 
			where the key is the movie and the value is the user:rating.
